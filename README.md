# Algorithms-Spring-24-PA2
This repository contains my solution to PA2 for the Algorithms course at National Taiwan University, Spring 2024.

## Problem Description
Given a set _C_ of _n_ chords of a circle, where no two chords share an endpoint, the task is to compute the maximum planar subset of chords.
Each chord is defined by its endpoints, and the goal is to find the subset of chords that do not overlap in the circle, maximizing the number of chords in this subset.

## Approach
Dynamic programming.

## Disclaimer
The code can be modified to reach better space/time efficiency.
